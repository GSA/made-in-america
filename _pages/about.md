# About this site

## What is MadeinAmerica.gov?

This site provides initial information on historical waivers as well as current waivers resulting from initial implementation of Executive Order 14005: Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers. This site will evolve over the next few months to incorporate more information, so please check back often.
