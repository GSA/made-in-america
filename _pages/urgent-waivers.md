# Urgent Waivers

When agencies are obligated by law to act more quickly than the review procedures allow due to urgent requirements, urgent waivers may be issued by the agency. These waivers are infrequent and will be shared on this page when available.

For additional information on these waivers, please contact the issuing agency using the points of contact at our _[resources page.](https://www.madeinamerica.gov/customer-service/resources/){:target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer"}_
