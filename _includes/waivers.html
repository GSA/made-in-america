        <p class="usa-prose">Various laws and regulations establish requirements for U.S. Government procurement and assistance to support American manufacturing.  Exceptions to these laws and regulations are allowable under certain conditions. For example, a waiver or exception from the obligation to “Buy American” will be allowed if a needed product is not made in the U.S. in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality or if it is made domestically, but not available at a reasonable cost.  To ensure that waivers from Made in America laws apply clearly, consistently and transparently, agencies will submit proposed waivers, along with information demonstrating that each waiver is justified, to the Made in America Office for review.</p>
